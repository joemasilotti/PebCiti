# PebBike for Pebble

PebBike is a simple Pebble app to show the nearest available bike hire dock or bike on your watch (works both in NYC and London).

## Credit

PebBike is javascript port of [PebCiti](https://github.com/joemasilotti/PebCiti) Pebble app created by [Tomas Vitek](http://tomasvitek.com/). [PebCiti](https://github.com/joemasilotti/PebCiti) was originally created by [Joe Masilotti](http://masilotti.com/).

## What does it do?

While PebBike uses almost the same watch app as PebCiti, it replaces [the iOS companion app for PebCiti](https://github.com/joemasilotti/PebCiti-iOS) with a javascript code, which runs in the official Pebble app. Additionally PebBike works both with iOS and Android, since no companion app is required.

## PebBike ❤️ New York City & Lodnon
