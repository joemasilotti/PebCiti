# PebCiti for Pebble

PebCiti is a simple Pebble app to show the nearest available bike hire dock or bike on your watch (works both in NYC and London).

## Credit

PebCiti is composed of two parts — the Pebble app was created by [Joe Masilotti](http://masilotti.com/) and the javascript code (which runs in the official Pebble app) has been developed by [Tomas Vitek](http://tomasvitek.com/).

## What does it do?

The app will show you the nearest available bike for hire or the nearest available docking space.

## PebBike ❤️ New York City & Lodnon

PebCiti works with **CitiBike** in NYC and with **Barclays Cycle Hire** in London. If you want to add more cities, add an issue on Github or submit a pull request.
Since it does not require a special companion app, it runs both on iOS and Android, all you need is the official Pebble app paired with a Pebble.
